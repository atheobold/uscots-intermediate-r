    "text": "Learning Objectives for Workshop\nWe will first establish a suggested common curriculum for intermediate R based on five areas: Data types and sources beyond comma-separated files, advanced and dynamic data visualization, complexities of unclean or unstructured data, speed and efficiency concerns for large or repeated analyses, and reproducible workflow for long-term collaborative projects.\nFollowing the introduction to each topic, we will have educators consider how these topics could be incorporated into a projet for their specific course."

    "section": "Intended Audience and Level",
    "text": "Intended Audience and Level\nWe expect attendees to have R fluency at the level of a typical introductory course, such as the textbook R for Data Science (Wickham, Çetinkaya-Rundel, & Grolemund 2023); as well as familiarity with some scattered intermediate to advanced topics, interpreted broadly.\nThe focus of this workshop will not be training in intermediate R skills, but rather in preparing educators to deliver higher-level R courses. We will provide resources, examples, and frameworks to empower attendees to expand their R knowledge and design a meaningful hands-on classroom experience."
