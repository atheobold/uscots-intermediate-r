## Why Professional Data Visualization?

Moving from "making plots" to "effective communication":

::: {.incremental}
- **Process vs. Product**: Teaching students to evaluate their own work
- **Advanced techniques**: Extensions, theming, interactivity
- **Professional standards**: Publication-ready graphics
- **Assessment strategies**: Clear grading principles
:::


## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will:

::: {.incremental}
1. Understand grading principles for "good" data visualization (process vs. product)
2. Know current ggplot2 extensions and advanced theming techniques
3. Be familiar with interactive visualization tools (plotly, htmlwidgets)

## Process vs. Product Assessment

Teaching visualization requires evaluating **both**:

::: {.incremental}
- **Process**: Design thinking, iteration, justification
- **Product**: Technical execution, clarity, aesthetics
- **Reflection**: Understanding of design choices
- **Critique**: Ability to evaluate others' work

**Goal: Students learn to self-assess, iterate, and improve**
:::

## What Makes a "Good" Visualization?

::: {.small}
**Technical Accuracy:**

- Appropriate chart type for data
- Correct use of scales and axes
- Accurate representation of relationships

**Design Principles:**

- Clear, informative titles and labels
- Appropriate color choices and accessibility
- Effective use of visual hierarchy
- Minimal cognitive load

**Communication:**

- Clear message or insight
- Appropriate for target audience
- Context and interpretation provided

## Grading Rubric for Visualizations

:::{.large}
⁇ **After considering some of the principles of "good" viz, what features should we be grading for?**
:::

. . . 

:::{.large}
⁇ **What message do we want to tell by the rubric?**
:::


## Example Grading Rubric Framework

::: {.small}
| **Criteria** | **Excellent (4)** | **Good (3)** | **Needs Work (2)** | **Poor (1)** |
|:-------------|:------------------|:-------------|:-------------------|:-------------|
| **Chart Type** | Match for data & message | Appropriate choice | Questionable fit | Wrong choice |
| **Design** | Polished, clean, accessible | Good design principles | Some issues | Many problems |
| **Message** | Compelling insight | Good communication | Unclear message | No clear point |
| **Process** | Shows iteration/ reflection | Evidence of thinking | Some documentation | No process shown |

**Teaching Tip:** Have students grade example visualizations using your rubric before using it on their own work

## Sometimes Bad Is The Way

**Challenge students to create a data visual does well in only one of the 4 criteria**
:::

* Can encourage them to think through the criteria without being too routine or safe
* Sharing within the class (e.g., on the class message board) can expand the learning
*
